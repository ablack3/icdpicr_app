          db trauma -- ICD-9-CM Trauma
          
          
          Version
          
          Version 3.0.
          
          ICDPIC Version 3.0 requires STATA 8.0 or higher.  ICDPIC Version 3.0 has
          been tested in STATA 10 and STATA 11, but the authors believe it should
          also work without incident in STATA 8 and STATA 9.  If you have any
          problems using ICDPIC Version 3.0 in STATA 8 or STATA 9, please inform the
          authors.
          
          ICDPIC Version 3.0 may be installed from within STATA using the ssc
          command.  If you installed a previous version of ICDPIC from the SSC
          archives website using the ssc command, we suggest that you first delete it
          by typing ssc uninstall icdpic followed by ssc install icdpic.
          Alternatively, you may use ssc install icdpic, replace.  See help for ssc.
          
          If you installed any previous ICDPIC files obtained directly from the
          authors, please delete them ALL (.ado, .hlp and .dta files) to avoid any
          conflicts with ICDPIC 3.0 files.
          
          Please enter complete variable names in the ICDPIC Version 3.0 dialog
          boxes.  Do not use abbreviations.
          
          New to Version 3.0 is the addition of a dialog box (.dlg) file associated
          with each individual ICDPIC Version 3.0 program (.ado) file.  To access the
          ICDPIC dialog box, and all the ICDPIC programs, type: db icdpic.  Typing
          icdpic, as in earlier versions, will still work, but ONLY with icdpic.  For
          example, to access the ICD-9-CM Trauma program directly, type: db trauma.
          Typing trauma, as in previous versions, will produce an error.
          
          Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to use path\file names
          containing spaces.
          
          Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is the ability to run in STATA 11.0.
          
          Fixed in ICDPIC Version 3.0 is a bug that caused the triss program to crash
          if the rts variable was named anything other than \"rts\".
          
          New in ICDPIC Version 3.0 (trauma program only) is the ability to choose
          whether an AIS value of 6 automatically forces an ISS of 75 or to
          automatically have all AIS values of 6 changed to an AIS value of 5 and
          then have the ISS calculated normally.
          
          All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have memory.  Each time a dialog box
          is opened within the same STATA session, it will remember the values last
          entered.
          
          All dialog boxes in ICDPIC Version 3.0 have the following buttons:
          
          OK executes the program and removes the dialog box from the screen.
          
          SUBMIT executes the program and leaves the dialog box on the screen.
          Note that if an error message is generated the dialog box may be
          minimized.
          
          CANCEL removes the dialog box from the screen and does nothing.  Clicking
          on the close icon of the dialog box does the same thing.
          
          HELP leaves the dialog box on the screen and presents the program help
          file.  The HELP button has a question mark on it.
          
          COPY leaves the dialog box on the screen and copies the program command
          to the clipboard.
          
          RESET resets the values of the controls in the dialog box to their
          initial state, just as if the dialog box were invoked for the first
          time.  Each time a user invokes a dialog box, its controls will be
          filled in with the values the user last entered.  RESET restores
          the control values to their defaults.  The RESET button has an R on
          it.

          Description
          
          trauma provides various classifications and characterizations of trauma
          based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, specifically codes for Nature of Injury
          (N-Codes) and External Cause of Injury (E-Codes).
          
          For each observation, for each valid N-Code, variables for data from the
          list below will be added to the user's data.  Note: variables for diagnosis
          codes that are not valid N-Codes will have missing values.
          
          
          Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) value
          ISS body region
          Barell body region by nature of injury diagnosis matrix category
          Anatomic profile component category
          
          
          Variables for 4 E-Codes will be added to the user's data for each
          observation.  Up to 4 valid E-Codes, excluding E-Code places (E849.X), will
          be taken from the diagnosis codes and placed in these variables.  Variables
          for data from the list below will be added to the user's data for each of
          the 4 E-Code variables.  Note: E-Code, and associated, variables for which
          there is not an E-Code will have missing values.
          
          
          CDC Classifications for E-Codes (Mechanism, both major and minor, and
          Intent)
          
          
          For each observation, variables for data from the list below will be added
          to the user's data.
          
          
          Maximum AIS severity for each ISS body region
          Maximum AIS severity overall
          Injury Severity Score (ISS)
          New Injury Severity Score (NISS)
          Lowest CDC classification of external cause of injury mechanism for all
          E-Codes captured
          Trauma type (Blunt or Penetrating)
          
          
          See also the Options and Remarks sections for IMPORTANT information on, and
          requirements for, trauma.
          
          
          Options
          
          ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes in the user's data may, or may not, contain a
          decimal point.  Simply choose the option that applies to your data in the
          ICD-9-CM Trauma dialog box.
          
          
          Remarks
          
          The user's data must contain ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes.  Diagnosis codes in
          the user's data must be of type string.  A decimal point in the diagnosis
          codes is optional.  Diagnosis codes should have a width of 5 (6 if a
          decimal point is present).  The diagnosis code prefix must be the same for
          all diagnosis codes and numbered sequentially starting with 1, for example,
          dx1...dxN.  External Cause of Injury codes (E-Codes) should be included in
          this set and must begin with a capital 'E'.
          
          trauma adds the following variables, where appropriate, to a new copy of
          the user's data stored on disk:
          
          
          sev_1-sev_n: AIS severity for diagnosis codes 1..n
          issbr_1-issbr_n: ISS body region for diagnosis codes 1..n
          brl_1-brl_n: Barell matrix category for diagnosis codes 1..n
          apc_1-apc_n: anatomic profile component category for diagnosis codes
          1..n
          mxaisbr1-mxaisbr6: maximum AIS severity for each ISS body region
          maxais: maximum AIS severity over all ISS body regions
          xiss: computed injury severity score
          niss: computed new injury severity score
          ecode_1-ecode_4: up to 4 E-Codes are captured excluding E-Code places
          (E849.X)
          mechmaj1-mechmaj4: CDC external cause of injury major mechanism for
          each E-Code captured
          mechmin1-mechmin4: CDC external cause of injury minor mechanism for
          each E-Code captured
          intent1-intent4: intent for each E-Code captured
          lowmech: lowest CDC external cause of injury major mechanism for all
          E-Codes captured
          bluntpen: type of trauma, blunt or penetrating, based on value of
          variable mechmaj1
          
          
          If a diagnosis code is not an N-Code, then its associated sev, issbr, brl
          and apc variables will contain missing values.
          
          mxaisbr1-mxaisbr6 variables are defined as 0 if there are no valid N-Codes
          for that body region and 9 if there are no valid N-Codes with a known
          severity for that body region.
          
          The maxais variable is defined as 0 if there are no valid N-Codes and 9 if
          there are no valid N-Codes with a known severity.
          
          The xiss and niss variables are defined as 75 if maxais is 6.  If there are
          no valid N-Codes, then they are defined as 0.  If there are no valid
          N-Codes with both a known severity and a known body region, then they are
          defined as 99.
          
          If an E-Code variable (ecode_1-e_code4) does not contain an E-Code then it,
          and its associated variables, (mechmaj, mechmin and intent) will contain
          missing values.
          
          The bluntpen variable is defined as follows:  P for penetrating trauma if
          the mechmaj1 variable is 0 or 4 and; B for blunt trauma if the mechmaj1
          variable is 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 13.
          
          Nature of Injury Codes (N-Codes) included in both ntab_s1.dta and
          ntab_s2.dta:
          
          
          800 - 904.9
          910 - 929.9
          940 - 957.9 (Note: burns, 940 - 949.5, are assigned AIS severity code 9
          (Unknown))
          959 - 959.9
          
          
          trauma requires the use of lookup tables ntab_s1.dta, ntab_s2.dta,
          etab_s1.dta and etab_s2.dta.  These data tables are supplied.  _s1 tables
          are for use with data without the decimal point in ICD-9-CM codes and _s2
          tables are for data that include the decimal point.  See help for icdpic,
          specifically the LOOKUP TABLES part of the Remarks section.
          
          
          NOTES ON METHODOLOGY
          
          trauma does not attempt to assign a specific AIS code for each N-Code, but
          only to classify injuries into a general severity and body region in order
          to allow for approximate severity scoring.  Meredith and colleagues have
          pointed out that any mapping method will be less accurate than direct AIS
          coding by trained registrars, but a program like ICDPIC (or ICDMAP-90) may
          be useful when the latter is impractical or impossible.  For calculation of
          severity scores, only the original version of the Abbreviated Injury Score
          (AIS) was used, as developed and published by the American Medical
          Association.  Later versions of the AIS, with more body regions and updated
          definitions, have been developed by the American Association for Automotive
          Medicine, and are available from that organization.  ICDPIC does not
          calculate these newer versions of the AIS.
          
          Injury Severity Score (variable xiss in the output data) is calculated
          according to the classic description of Baker and colleagues, but only over
          codes that have both a known severity and body region.
          
          
          NOTES ON VALIDATION
          
          To a large extent, the ICD to AIS mapping is \"self-validating\", since it
          reflects the consensus of a large number of registrars with actual specific
          injuries.  An interesting review of this general approach to decision
          making is given in Surowiecki's recent book on the \"Wisdom of Crowds\".
          
          ISS calculated by ICDPIC (XISS in Table 1 below) was compared to that
          calculated by ICDMAP-90 (ISS90 in Table 1 below) for 300,176 cases in the
          2002 NIS with a primary diagnosis of injury as defined above, excluding
          cases with a primary burn diagnosis.  In 4,458 of these (1.5%), ICDMAP-90
          was unable to assign an AIS score for any diagnosis.
          
          For 248,825 of the remaining 295,718 cases in the 2002 NIS (84.1%), XISS
          was exactly the same as the ISS90 assigned by ICDMAP-90.  When ISS was
          categorized as recommended by Copes and colleagues, 274,709 cases (92.9%)
          were assigned to the same category, and 294,358 (99.5%) to the same or an
          adjacent category (Table 1).

          Evaluating the most obvious discrepancies in Table 1, we discovered that
          the 60 cases given ISS90 of 50-75 by ICDMAP-90, but only XISS of 9-24 by
          ICDPIC, were entirely due to the ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 862.9 (open chest
          injury, not otherwise specified).  Conversely, the 40 cases given ISS90 of
          1-8 by ICDMAP-90, but XISS of 25-40 by ICDPIC, were mostly those where an
          injury region was ambiguous between head and face (and therefore not coded
          by ICDMAP-90), but had been assigned an AIS of 5 by contributors to NTDB
          (and therefore by ICDPIC).
