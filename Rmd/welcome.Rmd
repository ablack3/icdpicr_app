#Welcome to ICDPIC online

The intention of the ICD Programs for Injury Categorization (ICDPIC) is to provide 
inexpensive methods for translating International Classification of Diseases (Ninth Revision) 
diagnosis codes into standard injury categories and/or scores. Programs contained in this 
module can provide Abbreviated Injury Scale score (AIS), ISS body region, 
Injury Severity Score (ISS), an alternate version of the Charlson Score and 
Elixhauser categories.
